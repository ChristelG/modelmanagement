<h1>Model management service</h1>
<p>When you're building an AI solution your model is the most important asset of the project.
You start out with just one version of it, but as time goes by you will improve your model.
    You may even want to test multiple versions of a model before settling on a particular version.
    Doing this manually is quite a difficult job. That's why we created the model management service.</p>
<p>You can use this API to store multiple versions of models. </p>
<p>You can use the Python client to
directly link your machine learning jobs to the model management service.
    Link to this service from your microservices to use models without the need to manually copy
    model files into your deployed services.</p>
